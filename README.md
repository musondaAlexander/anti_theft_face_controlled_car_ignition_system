Welcome to the Anti_Theft_Face_Controlled_Car_Ignition_System!

This project aims to develop a system that enhances the security of your vehicle by utilizing face recognition technology to control the ignition system. The system is designed to prevent unauthorized access to your vehicle and reduce the risk of theft.

To use this system, you will need to install the required software and hardware components in your vehicle. The system will require you to enroll your facial features to create a database of authorized users. When an authorized user approaches the vehicle, the system will recognize their face and activate the ignition system.

Please note that this system is not a replacement for other security measures such as car alarms or locks. It is designed to provide an additional layer of security and prevent theft in case of a lost or stolen key.

We hope that this project will be useful for improving the security of your vehicle, and we welcome any feedback or contributions from the community.
